That seems like a lot, but lots of HDR movies are in 10 bit, which is (2^10)^3 = 1 billion color options!

        // For a quick primer on bit shifting and what we're doing here, in our ARGB color format image each pixel's colors are stored as a 32 bit integer, with 8 bits per color chanel (A, R, G, and B).
        //
        // So a pure red color would look like this in bits in our format, all red, no blue, no green, and 'who cares' alpha:
        //
        // 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000
        //  ^alpha   ^red     ^blue    ^green
        //
        // We want to grab only the red channel in this case, we don't care about alpha, blue, or green. So we want to shift the red bits all the way to the right in order to have them in the right position (we're storing colors as 8 bits, so we need the right most 8 bits to be the red). Red is 16 points from the right, so we shift it by 16 (for the other colors, we shift less, as shown below).
        //
        // Just shifting would give us:
        //
        // 00000000 00000000 11111111 11111111
        //  ^alpha   ^red     ^blue    ^green
        //
        // The alpha got pulled over which we don't want or care about, so we need to get rid of it. We can do that with the bitwise AND operator (&) which compares bits and the only keeps a 1 if both bits being compared are 1s. So we're basically using it as a gate to only let the bits we want through. 255 (below) is the value we're using as in binary it's 11111111 (or in 32 bit, it's 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111) and the result of the bitwise operation is then:
        //
        // 00000000 00000000 11111111 11111111
        // 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111
        // -----------------------------------
        // 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111
        //
        // So as you can see, it only keeps the last 8 bits and 0s out the rest, which is what we want! Woohoo! (It isn't too exciting in this scenario, but if it wasn't pure red and was instead a red of value "11010010" for instance, it would also mirror that down)
